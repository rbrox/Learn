## Applications

The types of problems solved by Artificially intelligent systems:

0. Search
Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move.

1. Knowledge
Representing information and drawing inferences from it.

2. Uncertainty
Dealing with uncertain events using probability.

3. Optimization
Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better—or the best—way to solve it.

4. Learning
Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience.

5. Neural Networks
A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.

6. Language
Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans.
